Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht Submod Villains and Vermin for Crusader Kings 2

Brief Manual:
Right-click your character and select Enable Villains & Vermin to see the decisions. They are all targeted decisions and can be used on rulers only except for where noted. To disable the decisions right-click your character and select Disable Villains & Vermin.

The Chaos Prince and Necromantic Invasions are built to roughly mimic the special troop summoning of an aggressive player. Please note that the Chaos Prince and Necromancer Invasions do spawn troops every two years until the leader is dealt with. If they are spawned in an isolated area they could get quite large over time. They are designed to give some challenge / create stories that the player can work into their campaigns.

Beastman Horde Invasion:
Will use a random province within the demesne of the target character for a large Beastman uprising. The uprising will reinforce every 2 years with Beastman troops until the leader is defeated, imprisoned, or dies. (Scales to garrison)

Chaos Prince Invasion:
Use on a ruler. If he is a vassal he will declare an independence war. Converts the ruler to a Prince of the chosen type with relevant traits and some magic items. Summons 3 supporting demons, a 21k daemonic horde, and more daemons come through the portal every 2 years until the ruler is defeated, imprisoned, or dies. The Princes will have unique event chains to flavor their brand of chaos in the world.

Create Master Necromancer:
Use on a ruler. If he is a vassal he will declare an independence war. Converts the ruler to a Necromantic Lord with appropriate traits and some magic items. Summons 3 supporting undead champions, a 21k undead horde with 160 vampire knights, and more undead are summoned every 2 years until the ruler is defeated, imprisoned, or dies.

Create Necromancer (may be used on non-ruler):
Gives target character Necromantic Lore, Magic Power 2, Necromancer trait, and summons a small amount of undead every 2 years under their command until they are defeated, imprisoned, or dead.

Create Undead Champion (may be used on non-ruler):
Converts target character into an undead immortal warrior. The champion can be killed and does not regenerate. Designed to allow the player to create an undead champion for a necromancer if needed.

Raise Necromantic Horde:
Must be used on an existing necromancer. It gives them a 2 year recurring summon of 1k undead and a 4k horde initially.

Time of Troubles:
Gives a ruler a large opinion malus to simulate periods of instability and rebellion.

Gives a vassal a large opinion bonus and makes them a schemer and ambitious.

Give Excellent Advisors:
